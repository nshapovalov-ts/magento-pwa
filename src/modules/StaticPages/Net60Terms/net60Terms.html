        <h2>General Terms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In these terms (“<b>Net 60 Terms</b>”), a term or phrase capitalised in these Net 60
                Terms has the same meaning as in our Buyer Terms unless expressly stated otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Net 60 Offer (defined below in clause 2) is subject to our standard Buyer terms
                and conditions available at
                <a href="/buyer-terms">https://www.tradesquare.com.au/buyer-terms</a>
                (“<b>Buyer Terms</b>”). You should read both these Net 60 Terms and the Buyer Terms
                carefully. By using or attempting to use the Net 60 Offer, you agree to accept and
                be bound by these Net 60 Terms and the Buyer Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                You acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand and agree to the Net 60
                Terms for the operation, establishment and use of a business credit account
                (“<b>Account</b>”).
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Net 60 Credit Offer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Subject to these Net 60 Terms, a Buyer will have access to a limited “Net 60” line
                of credit, pursuant to which TradeSquare will cover the upfront costs of the Buyer’s
                order and the Buyer will not be charged for the items until 60 days after the date
                of order on the TradeSquare platform (“<b>Net 60 Offer</b>”).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Net 60 Offer will apply to each order placed on the TradeSquare platform, until
                the Credit Limit (defined below in clause 5) is reached.
            </li>
            <li>
                TradeSquare has the right to amend, cancel or change the Net 60 Offer at any time
                without notice and in its sole discretion.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Application</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While the Net 60 Offer is extended to all Buyers, access to the Net 60 Offer will
                only apply if TradeSquare approves the Buyer’s application provided for on the
                TradeSquare Platform (“<b>Application</b>”). Such approval will create a contract
                between the Buyer and TradeSquare based on these Net 60 Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the purposes of assessing the Buyer’s Application, the Buyer authorises
                TradeSquare to make such enquiries as Tradesquare may require to be satisfied as to
                the creditworthiness of the Buyer. To this extent, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees
                that TradeSquare may:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (a) provide confidential information about the Buyer to an accredited third
                        party to assess the Buyer’s creditworthiness;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) request references from the Buyers bank or other credit providers,
                        credit bureaus or mercantile agencies;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (c) require the Buyer to link their point-of-sale system or accounting
                        system or bank to verify the Buyer’s business and conduct a
                        pre-authorisation of any such payment source; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (d) be authorised to make, directly or through third parties, any other
                        enquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and assess your
                        capability to make payments according to these Net 60 Terms in relation to
                        the Net 60 Offer,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        as TradeSquare requires from time to time. As noted, this may include
                        performing repayment capability checks and verifying information you provide
                        against third party databases.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                TradeSquare may accept, reject or add conditions to the application for credit made.
                The Buyer agrees that it is not entitled to any credit unless and until it receives
                notice in writing from TradeSquare that credit has been approved.
            </li>
            <li>
                All information that Tradesquare collects about you, either directly or via a third
                party, will be collected, used and stored in accordance with the Tradesquare Privacy
                Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                You authorise Tradesquare (or any third parties providing services on behalf of
                Tradesquare) to disclose to third parties, to the extent required by any applicable
                laws or regulations, any information in relation to you or your Tradesquare Account.
            </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Minimum Spend Threshold</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                TradeSquare reserves the right to require the Buyer to spend a minimum dollar amount
                per year to obtain products on the TradeSquare platform on credit (“<b
                    >Minimum Spend</b
                >”).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Minimum Spend for a Buyer will be provided for on the TradeSquare platform.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Credit Limit</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                TradeSquare will specify the maximum amount that may be charged to a Buyer as credit
                over a 60 day period (inclusive of GST) (“<b>Credit Limit</b>”). The Credit Limit
                may be reviewed and altered by TradeSquare at any time in their sole discretion.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Credit Limit for a Buyer will be provided for in your Account details.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once an invoice has been paid, that amount is returned to the Buyer’s Credit Limit
                and the Buyer can continue to place more orders under the Net 60 Offer so long as
                the Credit Limit is not exceeded (see clause 6).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Credit Limit for a Buyer is constantly subject to change and TradeSquare can
                either alter a Buyer’s Credit Level or remove their access to the Net 60 Offer at
                any time. In assessing a Buyer’s Credit Limit, TradeSquare may (but is not obliged
                to), consider the Buyer’s purchasing behaviour over time by looking at, amongst
                other items:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (a) the timeliness of the payment of invoices;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) maintenance of healthy return rates;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (c) returning items in good condition;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (d) utilising the Buyer’s existing, available terms; and / or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (e) the Buyer linking their point-of-sale system and/or bank to TradeSquare.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                TradeSquare may, on request in writing by the Buyer, also agree in writing to alter
                the Credit Limit. Following such a request, TradeSquare may:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (a) require additional data from the Buyer; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) request an additional credit check be performed on the Buyer,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to assess whether to alter the Buyer’s Credit Limit. TradeSquare makes no
                        promises as to whether it will amend the Credit Limit and the time it will
                        take to process such a request.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Exceeding the Credit Limit</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Buyer agrees that the Credit Limit is a maximum limit, and the Buyer is required
                to ensure at all times that the aggregate amount of all outstanding invoices issued
                by TradeSquare to the Buyer is less than the Credit Limit.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the aggregate amount of all outstanding invoices reaches the Credit Limit, or a
                Buyer places an order that exceeds its Credit Limit, it may:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (a) elect to immediately pay for the order without accessing the Net 60
                        Offer;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) apply to ZIP Pay or other applicable finance providers to facilitate
                        secure financing options; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (c) request that TradeSquare increase its Credit Limit in accordance with
                        clause 5.6.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Instances where the Net 60 Offer does not apply</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If a Buyer does not qualify for the Net 60 Offer or TradeSquare has rejected their
                Application, payment for products is due when an order is processed on the
                TradeSquare platform. Such payment will be processed automatically.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Repayment</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Buyer must pay TradeSquare no later than 60 days from the date of the applicable
                order on the TradeSquare Platform (“<b>Charge Date</b>”), and failure to do so will
                result in a default of the Net 60 Offer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Payment for any credit under the Net 60 Offer is to be provided for in accordance
                with the Buyer’s Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, we may rely on direct debit for
                payment as provided for in the Buyer’s Terms, unless otherwise specified by us in
                our sole discretion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Where the Buyer has defaulted in its payment obligations under the Net 60 Offer,
                TradeSquare may:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (a) provide notice that all money payable to TradeSquare by the Buyer has
                        become immediately due and payable;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) suspend access to the TradeSquare platform until it has received full
                        payment;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (c) after five (5) days from the Charge Date, charge an additional $5 per
                        day from the due date for payment until the date payment is received up to a
                        limit of 15% of the total cost of the applicable order on which the Buyer
                        has failed to repay by the Charge Date;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (d) drop or remove the Credit Limit for the Buyer;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (e) appoint third party debt collection agencies to collect any amounts
                        owing to under this Agreement without your consent or prior notice;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (f) disclose to any third party involved in the collection of debts, to the
                        extent permissible by any applicable laws or regulations, any information in
                        relation to you or your Tradesquare account including, but not limited to,
                        any personal information for the purposes of collection of an outstanding
                        debt, late or missed payment amounts and any defaults on the account; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (g) deduct any amounts owing by the Buyer from any fee payable under any
                        other contract.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Buyer will be liable for all costs, charges and expenses incurred by TradeSquare
                in recovering any outstanding monies including debt collection agency fees,
                administration fees and legal costs (on a full indemnity basis) which are payable to
                TradeSquare on demand.
            </li>
            <li>
                As noted in clause 5.4, we may, but are not obliged to, take into consideration
                early repayment as a factor in increasing your Credit Limit for future orders.
            </li>

        <h2>Buyer Obligations and Warranties</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (a) it is responsible for and indemnifies TradeSquare against any
                        unauthorised use of the Credit Limit and must notify TradeSquare of any
                        unauthorised transaction immediately after it becomes aware of such
                        transactions;

                    <li>
                        (b) it will not create multiple Accounts in order to circumvent the limits
                        placed under the Net 60 Terms; and

                    <li>
                        (c) it will notify TradeSquare in writing as soon as practicable and in any
