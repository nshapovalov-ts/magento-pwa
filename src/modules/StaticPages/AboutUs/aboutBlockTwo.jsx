                        But don't just take our word for it - people like you helped plan
                        TradeSquare.

                        We talked to buyers including retailers, childcare businesses, schools,
                        councils and HR managers seeking corporate gift ideas. They told us they
                        want more product inspiration and choice when sourcing direct - and that
                        they want their orders delivered on time, which is rarely possible when
                        dealing with overseas trading platforms. They also find it cumbersome
                        filling out multiple credit applications with different suppliers and
                        theyâ€™re tired of trying to predict taxes and fees on imported goods.

                        Suppliers shared their problems too. All too often they discourage new small
                        business clients because of the credit checks and paperwork process to on
                        board them. TradeSquare solves that problem by vetting buyers and
                        guaranteeing payments so Suppliers don't have to track payments and risk
                        defaulters.

                        In the end it all comes down to trust. Whether you are a buyer or a vendor
                        you can TRUST TradeSquare to take away many pain points in your business.
