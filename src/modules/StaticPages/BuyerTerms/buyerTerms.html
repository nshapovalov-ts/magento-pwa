        <h2>Marketplace only</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Platforms provide a marketplace through which you can buy products or services
                from Sellers (<b>Transaction</b>). Our involvement in the Transaction is limited to
                that of a facilitator to the Transaction in consideration of which we charge
                relevant Sellers a commission payment. We are not and do not purport to be a Seller,
                guarantor, or otherwise a contractual party to the Transaction. We are in no way
                responsible for completion of the Seller’s obligations and by transacting with the
                Seller you assume all legal and transaction risk in dealing with the Seller.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our involvement in the Transaction is limited to the following capacity:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    (a) Connecting you with the Seller via our Platforms;

                    (b) Facilitating the Transaction by allowing the Seller to sell and you to buy a
                    product or service through the Platforms; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    (c) Collecting payment from the Buyer and remitting it to the Seller.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                When you buy a product or service from a Seller through the Platforms, you are
                entering into a legally binding contract with the Seller. We are not a party to this
                contract and are not responsible for the performance of you or the Seller’s
                obligations under this contract.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sellers may have their own terms and conditions for the products or services they
                have listed for sale on the Platforms. When this is the case, your purchase is
                subject to the Seller’s terms and conditions which you should review carefully
                before finalising the Transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                In some cases, individual Sellers may not have written terms and conditions for the
                products or services they are selling on the Platforms. Where this is the case, your
                purchase is subject to terms and conditions implied at law (but only to the extent
                that such implied terms are not expressly and lawfully excluded by the Seller).
                Please make yourself aware of such implied terms before finalising the Transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                By using the Platforms, you fully release and discharge us from any claims, actions,
                demands or proceedings which may arise from a Transaction. You agree that we are in
                no way liable for any obligation arising from a Transaction, including but not
                limited to:

            </li>
            <li>
                Sellers will have their own policies and procedures in relation to returns. We make
                no guarantee and do not warrant in any way the policies and procedures of individual
                Sellers in relation to returns. Where you wish to return an item, we are under no
                obligation to help facilitate that return.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the extent that the Australian Consumer Law applies to a Transaction, any claims
                with respect to a product or service must be made against the Seller only and you
                agree and fully release and discharge us from any liability, claim, or action

                code, vouchers or discount, you will only receive a refund for the final price you
                paid for that item (i.e. the "cash" component you actually contributed to the
                transaction).

                cancel or return only certain items purchased in a larger basket, the refund amount
                will reflect the pro-rata discounted cash contribution you are taken to have paid
                for the returned items.
