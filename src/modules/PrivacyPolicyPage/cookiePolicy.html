    <p>
        On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with additional options to opt
        out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifiers. For
        example, you may use the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to “Opt
        out of Interest-Based Ads” (on Android) which allows you to limit the use of information
        about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.

        Certain targeted advertisements that we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) display

        interactive properties operated by third parties may include the “Ad Choices” icon or
        another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements. You may click on
        the AdChoices icon or visit www.aboutads.info to receive more information about the
        collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based
        advertising or to learn how to opt out of having your data used for interest based
