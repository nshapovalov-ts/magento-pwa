    _This command should be used only in a development environment_

    ```
    yarn buildpack create-custom-origin .

## Base commands

<br>

In project directory you can run commands:

### `yarn watch`

This command build application in development mode and runs local dev server

### `yarn storybook`

Runs storybook for basic venia-ui components

### `yarn build`

Builds application using webpack into dist folder

### `yarn start`

Start server for previously builded application

---

## Project structure

### `/i18n`

Files for translations. All basic texts are here. You can add new text or change existing. Used [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/) library

_TODO: It might be a good idea to create a webpack config to find all the files in separate i18n folders and chain them together. Then it will not be necessary to store all translations in one place or create separate packages_

### `/public`

Folder for static files, files from this folder remain untouched during build

### `src/components`

Here are reusable components, as well as files for overwriting default ui components. For example, the folder may contain only a css file, which, when assembled, will overwrite the styles of the default component with the same name, or interceptor file for update some logic in original ui component file.

Rewriting is done with a package [@larsroettig/component-targetables](https://github.com/larsroettig/component-targetables).

_TODO: need to create stories for all reusable components_

### `src/helpers`

Here will be all reusable functions, such as different utils, formatters, date functions etc.

### `src/modules`

Separate custom react components consisting of other components, forming some kind of unified functionality. Everything that is not related to reusable components is located here.

### `src/RootComponents`

Main default components such as home page (cms), products page, search results page. Automatically mapped based on server responses.

### `src/targets`

Interceptors for default logic, such as custom hooks, routing data and all other functionality that can be updated without importing default files.

### `tailwind-pwa-theme`

Some custom values for tailwind configuration and creating global css variables. Will be updated as needed, the old default values ​​of css variables need to be updated with new ones from the theme.

### `local-intercept.js`

File for importing interceptors. Don't need to create separate packages on every target interceptor.

## Other things

It would be nice to:

-   Add typescript support
-   Add stories for custom reusable components
-   Add tests for custom components (when the components enter the stable phase with only minor updates)
